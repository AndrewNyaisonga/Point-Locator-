# Point-Locator-


This project helps to determine if two or more points are on the same plane given a set of lines in a unit square. You will be asked to provide the number of lines you want to work with, and enter the end points of each line. Then you will be asked to give the number of points you want to determine and then the points themselves. THe program will tell you if two or more points share the plane and what points are they. THe program uses binanry search tree to represent the points and to determine the locations of the planes. The project has 5 classes, the BST class which has the binary search tree representation,MyTreeNode that contains all the nodes, Segment which represent the segment, Point which is represents the points and PointLocator which contain all the main method and it's the operator.
